************************** RELEASE NOTES *************************

******************** Enhancements Since Ver 2.0 ******************

Horizontal Bar Charts
=====================
ChartDirector now supports horizontal bar charts at the same level
as vertical bar charts. For example, stacked bar charts, multi-bar
charts, 3D effects, data labels, clickable image maps, etc., are
all available in horizontal bar charts.

Arbitrary X-Axis Data
=====================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, data points are assumed to
be evenly distributed on the x-axis. ChartDirector now supports
arbitrary x-values for data points. Data series can be irregularly
distributed on the x-axis.

Scatter Chart Layer
===================
Scatter Chart Layer is a new ChartDirector layer type. Scatter 
charts plot data points at arbitrary xy positions using built-in 
or user defined symbols.

Trend Line Layer
================
Trend Line Layer is a new ChartDirector layer type. A trend line 
is a straight line that best fits a number of data points computed 
using linear regression (least square method).

CandleStick Chart Layer
=======================
CandleStick Layer is a new ChartDirector layer type. Candlestick 
charts represent high-low-open-close data as "candle shapes".

Pie Chart Side Label Layout
===========================
ChartDirector now supports a new method of positioning sector
labels where the labels are positioned on the left and right sides
of the chart (instead of circularly around the pie). In this new
method, the labels can automatically shift up and down to avoid
overlapping with each others, which typically will occur when there
are a lot of very small sectors crowded together.

Line Chart Missing Data Points Handling
=======================================
For a line chart, previous version of ChartDirector handles missing
data points (NoValue) as discontinuous lines.

In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, a line can be drawn to join through the
missing point. The line can be of the same style and color as the
normal lines in the line chart, or can be of different style (e.g.
a dash line with different color).

Data Gap for HLOC
=================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, the data points for HLOC
charts always use up all the available width, that is, there is no
gap between adjacent HLOC data points. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, it
is now possible to specify the gap in between adjacent HLOC data
points (similar to how bar gaps are specified in bar charts).

Axis Width
==========
ChartDirector now supports configurable axis width.

Configurable Zero Affinity During Auto-Scaling
==============================================
When ChartDirector auto-scales an axis, it will try to start the 
axis from zero, unless the data range (difference between maximum 
and minimal values) is small compare to the data values. For 
example, if the data values are in between 1000.2 to 1000.8, 
ChartDirector will not start the axis from zero, because the data 
range (= 0.6) is small compare to the data values. In previous 
versions of ChartDirector, small means 20% or less (that is, zero 
affinity of 80%).

In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, the zero affinity is configurable. A 
zero affinity of 100% will ensure ChartDirector always start the 
axis from zero. A zero affinity of 0% will mean ChartDirector will 
not have any special preference to the zero point when performing 
auto- scaling.

Sign Character Numeric Formatting
=================================
ChartDirector now supports configurable negative sign character in 
numeric formatting. By default, the negative sign character is "-". 
A common usage is to set it to an empty string, so negative numbers 
will look like positive numbers. This is often used in y-axis that 
pointd downwards (such as represeting the depth of the ocean floor).

Data Labels Support for All XY Chart Layers
===========================================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, only bar chart layers and 
line chart layers support data labels. This is now extended to all 
layer types.

Custom Data Label
=================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, data labels applies to all
data points. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, you can add a custom data
label to a particular data point to override the general data label
settings.

Data Label Formatting
=====================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, data labels show the values 
of the data points, with configurable numeric formatting. In 
ChartDirector Ver 2.5, data labels can also be formatted to show 
other things related to the data points, such as the data set 
names, the x-label of the data points, etc. Data label formatting 
now employs the same parameter substitution meachanism 
used in query parameters formatting in image maps.

Legend Keys Formatting for Pie Charts
=====================================
For a pie chart, by default, the legend keys will contain the names
of the sectors. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, the legend keys can be
formatted to also include the values of the sectors as well
as the percentages of the sectors.

Configurable Legend Keys Ordering
=================================
By default, the name of the first data set will be entered as the
first legend key, the name of the second data set as the second
legend key, and so on.

ChartDirector now supports entering the names as the legend keys in
reverse order, or not to enter the names as legend keys at all.

One common scenario is for a stacked bar chart with positive data
and using vertical legend keys layout. In a stacked bar, the first
data set will appear at the bottom, and subsequent data sets will
stack on top (assuming positive data). If a vertical legend
box is used, it may be desirable the last data set to be the top
legend key, and the first data set to be the bottom legend key. In
other words, it may be desirable to reverse the order of the legend
keys for that stacked bar chart layer.

X-Axis Mark Labels
==================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, only y-axis marks have text
labels. This is now extended to x-axis marks.

Mark Label Positioning
======================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, mark labels are positioned 
as tickd on the axis. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, it is now possible 
to configure where to put the mark labels (e.g. on top of the mark 
lines).

More Auto Data Colors
=====================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, the default auto-color 
palette contains 16 colors. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5, the color 
palette has increased to 32 data colors.

SameAsMainColor
===============
ChartDirector now supports a special color called SameAsMainColor, 
which means the color is the same as the main color used for the 
primary object of interest. This is typically used to specify the 
colors of objects associated with data sets. 

For example, in a pie chart, if the sector label background color 
is set to SameAsMainColor, the actual sector label background 
colors will be the same as the fill colors of sectors to which they 
are associated with.

ImageMapWidth for Lines
=======================
For a clickable line chart, if the line is thin, it would be hard 
to click on it. So when creating the image map for the line, 
ChartDirector always assume the line is very thick, no matter what
its actual thickness is.

In previous version of ChartDirector, the assumed thickness for the
purpose of image map generation is always 10 pixels. This is now
configurable.

More flexible getHTMLImageMap parameters
========================================
When using the getHTMLImageMap method to generate image maps,
ChartDirector performs parameter substitution on the query
parameters and the extra attributes arguments of the method. This
is now extended to include the url argument. Also, the method now
better supports using client side Javascript as the url.


********************** Changes Since Ver 2.0 *********************

Pie Chart Sectors Have No Border By Default
===========================================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, the default sector border
color is equal to the default line color. In ChartDirector Ver 2.5,
the default sector border color is "SameAsMainColor", which means
the color is the same as the corresponding sector fill color. As a
result, the sectors appear as borderless.

The reason for this change is because in most cases, the pie chart
looks better without the borders, especially when there are small
sectors.

Auto Data Colors are Slightly Lighter
=====================================
The automatic data colors are slightly lighter than that in the
previous versions of ChartDirector. For example, the original red
color (0xff0000) is change to 0xff3333, and the original blue color
(0x0000ff) is changed to (0x6666ff).

The reason for this change is to enhance the readability of data
labels. For example, in a bar chart, the data labels are drawn on
top of the bar segments. If the data colors are too dark, it is
hard to read the data labels (which by default is black in color).

1 Pixel Layout Change
=====================
Compare to previous versions of ChartDirector, the position of the
plot area now moves 1 pixel downwards, and its width also increases
by 1 pixel. This more accurately reflects the position and size of
the plot area as specified in the setPlotArea method.

ArrayIndex in RecordSetToArray Function
=======================================
(The RecordSetToArray function applies to ChartDirector for
ASP/COM/VB only.)

In previous versions of ChartDirector, the RecordSetToArray
function will use the value in the "Index" column as the array
index. The column name is now changed to "ArrayIndex". It is
because "Index" is a reserved word in SQL and the use of "Index" as
column name is incompatible with a number of databases. For
compatibility, the "Index" column name is also supported but its
use is discouraged.


********************** Upgrade Considerations ********************

Code Compatibility
==================
ChartDirector Ver 2.5 is designed to be code compatible with all
previous versions of ChartDirector.

That means all source code should run without modification.

For the C++ Edition of ChartDirector, although the C++ source code
does not need to be modified, they have to be recompiled and linked
to the new ChartDirector library "chartdir25.dll". If you do not
want to recompile your source code, you can continue to use the
existing ChartDirector library "chartdir20.dll" in existing
projects, and use the new ChartDirector library "chartdir25.dll" in
new projects. These two DLL libraries can co- exists on the same
machine without conflicts.

Behavioural Compatibility
=========================
The charts produced by ChartDirector Ver 2.5 could be slightly
different from the charts produced by earlier versions of
ChartDirector using the same source code. The section on "Changes
Since Ver 2.0" describes the changes in details.

License Compatibility
=====================
Advanced Software Engineering's licensing policy is that all
commercial software licenses will be entitled to free upgrade for
the next version of the software, and thereafter, free upgrade for
another 12 months.

Therefore, all existing ChartDirector Ver 1.x and Ver 2.x licenses
are still valid for ChartDirector Ver 2.0. The license code is
compatible and does not need to change.

Upgrade Procedure
=================
To upgrade ChartDirector, simply install the new version on top of 
the old version.

Like all other software installation process, you should stop your 
existing version of ChartDirector before installing a new version. 
If you are using a web server with ChartDirector, you may need to 
stop your web server.

For Microsoft IIS, you will need to stop the "World Wide Web 
Publishing" services using the Service Control Panel (in W2K, it is 
in Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services) Stopping IIS using 
the "Internet Services Manager" is not sufficient, as it does not 
actually unload the web server.

For the ASP/COM/VB and .NET editions of ChartDirector, the first 
time you run the setup program, it will prompt you to uninstall the 
existing version of ChartDirector. After that, you can run the 
setup program again, and it will install the new version.

For the .NET editions of ChartDirector, please remember to UPDATE 
the "netchartdir.dll", which may have been copied to the "bin" 
subdirectory under the ASP.NET application root, in the Global 
Assembly Cache or in other places.

For the PHP/Perl/Python Editions of ChartDirector, please remember 
to UPDATE the files "phpchartdir.php", "perlchartdir.pm" and 
"pychartdir.py" respectively. These files may have been copied to 
your scripting directory or directories. It is not possible to use 
the old versions of these library files with the new version of 
ChartDirector DLL.
